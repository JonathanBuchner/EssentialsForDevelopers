## Discrete Math

Writing code is secretly doing discrete math.  Discrete math underlies all the work done by a developer, although much of it may be abstracted away.

###  What is Discrete Math

> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous to discrete variables, having a bijection with the set of natural numbers) rather than "continuous" (analogously to continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic. By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics".

Discrete mathematics usually works with distinct units on a number line rather tha a continuous number line 

![Continuos Number Line]()

Discrete math usually doesn't include irrational numbers like $ \sqrt{2} $ or imaginary numbers like $ 3 + \sqrt{-1} $).  Discrete maths likes numbers likes rational numbers like $ 2/3 $, negative numbers like $ -5 $, $ 0 $, and especially positive integers like 1, 2, 3...42. 

### Who uses Discrete Math?

Computers and coding are built upon the concepts of discrete math.
