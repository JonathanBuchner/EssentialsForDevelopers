## Typing

- This author not aware of any research that isolating typing practice from a larger goal of learning to code is beneficial.

- My anecdotal evidence from interviewing online and watching students learn to code is that faster CPM (characters per minute) has always been an overall stronger candidates or student.  When programming, typing at less than a character a second (60 CPS) may slow down learning because the focus is actually on the typing. Two characters a second (120 CPS) is fast.  

> The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute (WPM). That translates into between 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM).

- Isolating practice on the communication medium of one's craft (writer : penmanship on paper:: mathematician : chalk on a blackboard:: programmer: hands on the keyboard) seems like misled training.  Alas, however, the experts tend to become experts on their medium and putting aside some time to practice helps. 

- NOTE: Writer whose thoughts are interrupted through focusing on penmanship (how do I write a readable P?) or spelling a word?  It's ridiculous that a writing class would include penmanship practice!

- NOTE: A mathematical instructor who can organize their thoughts on a chalk board. But time put aside in class to practice writing in on a chalkboard! 

-  If typing is a strength, practice may be more fun, but minimally helpful for an overall goal to code.  If typing is challenging, you have the most to gain through intentional practice. We tend to practice our strengths and ignore are weaknesses--if your instinct is to ignore typing because it's difficult for you, you are the ripe candidate for practice. 

- Note: Remember most IDE's will not have a spell checker.  Code often does not compile--or worse has a run time bug--because of fat-finger errors.

> Fat finger or fat-finger syndrome (especially in the financial sector) is a slang term referring to an unwanted secondary action when typing. When a finger is bigger than the touch zone, with touchscreens or keyboards, there can be inaccuracy and one may hit two keys in a single keystroke. An example is buckled instead of bucked.

- Looking at the for c# loop below, we see the symbols like ( ) + = [], {} ; used much more often then when we write, for example, an email. Several of these symbols require using our right pinky finger which is often the finger that needs the most training, followed by the right ring finger.

```csharp
for (var i = 0; i < args.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(args[i]);
}

```

- Being able to type the below sentence without looking at your fingers at a speed of two (2) characters a second earns a cool programmer point (120 cpw).

```csharp
if (a != b) { par(); var p = new int[]; p[i] = 0; public class{}  a >= b ? a : b; ($"a: {a}");  ..\ { 9-0*2+3; } [] for (var i = 0; i < x.Length; i++) {} // NOTE: 
```

- A good starting point is to be able to hit all the above keys consistently without looking at your hands at any speed.

- For learning to type, the evidence is that using the same finger to hit the same key each time is important. Using a specific finger (or even using all your fingers to type on the keyboard) is less important. It is best to hit each key from fingers starting on the "home row," which for most keyboards is the left fingers on "asdf" and right fingers on "jkl;".  Choose a finger--and once you choose, keep using the same finger--where eventually you can hit the key consistently without needing to look at your hands to reference their position to any keys on the keyboard.
